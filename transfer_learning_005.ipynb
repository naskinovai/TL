The slides were acquired and digitized at 2 different centers using a 40x objective (resultant pixel resolution of 0.243 microns). We undersample this at 10x to increase the field of view. We follow the train/test split from the Camelyon16 challenge [2], and further hold-out 20% of the train WSIs for the validation set. To prevent selecting background patches, slides are converted to HSV, blurred, and patches filtered out if maximum pixel saturation lies below 0.07 (which was validated to not throw out tumor data in the training set). The patch-based dataset is sampled by iteratively choosing a WSI and selecting a positive or negative patch with probability p. Patches are rejected following a stochastic hard-negative mining scheme with a small CNN, and p is adjusted to retain a balance close to 50/50."
